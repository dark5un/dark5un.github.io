For what is worth keeping a blog in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) might sound easy. Posting pages in [GitHub](https://github.com) might sound even easier. But its not.
Bootstrapping this blog for example took me some time to figure out as I wanted to have everything included. The whole battery pack.
So I picked up a bunch of plugins, check a nice theme and modified it a bit.
Locally everything started to work fine.
Then it began to fall apart.

Sometimes I have to think small. I probably should use other platforms like medium to express. Well you cannot blame me for looking something closer to editor/git pair. 

And there we are now.

Plain simple almost vanilla blog. For now.

Some [nice guidance](https://github.com/blog/1992-eight-lessons-learned-hacking-on-github-pages-for-six-months) always found after a bunch of trials just to make Murphy's law worth something.

Finally I used [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). Less hassle. Seriously.
